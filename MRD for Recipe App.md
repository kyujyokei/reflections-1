#Eat Fat Meat
So we look ever GREATER in mass, that's a must do.

#Vision
For taiwanese people who must cook by themselves for keeping healthy and avoiding eating contaminated food, our product is a Lifesaver that provides many kinds of recipes with food without processing and using as less as possible seasoning. Unlike "Recipes",which is wellknown as a recipe app, we offer recipe that is suitable for taiwanese and include less unnatural materials.

/*
Consider using Geoffrey Moore’s positioning statement from Crossing the Chasm, i.e., “For [target customer segments] who must [problem to be solved], our product is a new [category name] that provides [solution to the problem]. Unlike [current solutions], we offer [key differentiating factor].”
*/

#Motivation
Some new menu to provide for housewives.
Someone want to cook but not sure to prepare ingredient and cooking methods.


##Personas
Present your primary and any secondary personas.
In what ways are early adopters likely to differ from mainstream users?
##Unmet Needs
For each persona you will target, what are your hypotheses regarding the most important unmet needs that your product will address? How big is the pain for target users?
Format of customer problem hypotheses should be: “I believe [customer segment] experiences [problem] when doing [task]” OR “I believe [customer segment] experiences [problem] because of [constraint].”
What evidence have you collected to validate these hypotheses? Provide an overview of your research design (questions posed, sample size, etc.) and results here, and include detail on design/results as appendices (e.g.,  interview guides, interview notes, survey questions,  survey results, etc.).
##Existing Solutions
What existing solutions do target customers currently rely upon? What hypotheses do you have about ways in which existing solutions are insufficient in meeting key customer needs?
What evidence have you collected to validate these hypotheses? Present a competitor feature matrix, if relevant, and provide detail on your research design.
##Differentiation
Why are we best equipped to pursue this opportunity?
##Why Now?
Has anything changed externally or internally that makes this opportunity available to us now?

#Use Scenarios
For each key use scenario, present a step-by-step narrative that describes how a persona would experience an ideal solution that addresses their unmet needs and allows them to meet their goals The scenarios should not discuss specific UI elements and technologies to be employed; nor should you present wireframes. However, the envisioned solution should be feasible with existing technology (so, no anti-gravity ray guns, please).

(Use scenarios -- also called “context scenarios” by design guru Alan Cooper  -- are more descriptive than use cases, which tend to be more terse, step-by-step descriptions of interactions between a user and a system.)

If use scenarios vary by persona, be sure to explain any differences.

#Market Size
Is the the total addressable market (TAM) for the proposed solution big enough to warrant further development? Note: TAM reflects the size of the entire market for solutions that meet the need you’ve targeted, NOT projected revenue for your product.

Don’t overdo this analysis. Since new markets have blurry boundaries and are rife with uncertainty, trying to estimate with precision is a waste of time. Backers just want to know you are targeting a big enough market to eventually build a sustainable business.

#Adoption Barriers
What are the main barriers to customer adoption? In particular
Are priorities aligned across all members of the decision making unit responsible for purchase decisions?
What switching costs do users confront when abandoning existing solutions?
How sensitive are early adopters likely to be to vendor reputation?

#Risks/Key Dependencies
What are other possible failure modes? For example:
- Privacy concerns?
- Legal/patent risks?
- Piracy concerns?
- Interdependencies with key internal systems/processes/operations?
- Availability of required 3rd-party complements?

Consider presenting risks in table format with columns providing detailed description and possible mitigants for each risk .

#Strategic Considerations
For new products that are being developed for existing organizations, is the proposed solution consistent with the organization’s strategy? Will it complement existing products?

#Team Members
List everyone who will be working on the project, along with their expected role and contact info.

#Go/No Go Recommendation

#Customer Research Data Appendices
Include any customer discovery data along with examples of research instruments (e.g., survey forms, interview guides) that you think might be helpful to the reader. Be specific about how you conducted your research, e.g., how you selected your samples.
